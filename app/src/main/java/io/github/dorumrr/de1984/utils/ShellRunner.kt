/**
 * Runs one external process with a ceiling that can actually fire, and returns its output.
 *
 * The single place in the app that starts a [Process] ITSELF - nine call sites that had each copied
 * the same three bugs. It is NOT the only way the app reaches a shell: RootManager and
 * HiddenApiHelper go through libsu (`Shell.cmd`, `Shell.getCachedShell`), which keeps one long-lived
 * root shell and drains it on its own threads. That route has none of the three bugs below and none
 * of the protections either - it has no ceiling at all.
 *
 * The distinction matters when reading a bug report. IptablesFirewallBackend and
 * BootProtectionManager both test root FIRST, so on a ROOTED device the firewall never comes through
 * here. Everything below applies to the Shizuku path and to the raw `su` fallbacks.
 *
 * ## 1. A timeout wrapped round blocking code does nothing
 *
 * Nothing on this path checks for coroutine cancellation: not `Runtime.exec`, not the stream reads,
 * not `Process.waitFor()`, and not `Binder.transact` underneath Shizuku's remote process. A
 * `withTimeoutOrNull` placed straight round them registers a cancel that nothing ever acts on. It
 * does not even flag the overrun: when the block never suspends it runs to completion and its value
 * is returned, so the `?: -1` fallbacks written next to those guards were unreachable code.
 * Measured: a 500ms ceiling round a 3000ms blocking call returned the value after 3027ms.
 *
 * So the blocking half runs on [shellScope], which is NOT a child of the caller. Structured
 * concurrency would put the bug straight back, because a scope waits for children before it gives
 * up and these children cannot be cancelled. The caller waits on `await()` instead - a real
 * suspension point a timeout can cut - and on expiry walks away and destroys the process. Closing
 * the remote ends is the only thing that frees a read already blocked on a pipe.
 *
 * ## 2. Draining one pipe at a time deadlocks
 *
 * stdout and stderr are separate pipes with their own ~64KB kernel buffer. Reading stdout to EOF
 * first hangs forever on any command that fills stderr: the child blocks writing stderr, therefore
 * never closes stdout, therefore the stdout read never ends. Measured: still hung after 4 seconds
 * on 200KB of stderr, and freed only by `destroy()`. Both pipes are drained together here.
 *
 * ## 3. Nothing is destroyed on the abandoned path
 *
 * `destroy()` is what releases the process and its pipes. Shizuku's `ShizukuRemoteProcess` also
 * holds itself in a static CACHE until its binderDied fires. See issue #93.
